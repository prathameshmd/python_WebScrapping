# python_WebScrapping
Scrapping of Quotes from a website .
In this project, quotes from a website called www.thequotes.com were scrapped using BeautifulSoup.
First requests and bs4 library was installed.
After getting the HTML code from BeautifulSoup we scrapped the necessary data.
When the code was successfull, we created a .csv file of the data.
Both code and .csv files are uploaded here.
